com.google.Chrome Flatpak manifest without extra data
=====================================================

This is a fork of the [com.google.Chrome Flatpak manifest](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome)
with the extra data removed and embedded like a regular Flatpak.

The output of the build can be installed offline or packaged without any
online dependencies.

Because Google does not want Chrome to be redistributed, Flatpak from this
manifest cannot be made available publicly, but you can always build your
own for offline installation.  This is not legal advice, please check
with your legal counsel.
